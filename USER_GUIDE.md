## Study Streak System

### How It Works
The app uses an **honesty-based system** to track your study habits.

#### Daily Check-In
- A popup appears once per day asking: **"Did you study today?"**
- Be honest with yourself!

#### Two Options:

**✅ Yes, I Did!**
- If you studied yesterday: streak increases by 1
- If you missed days: streak resets to 1
- Your commitment matters!

**❌ No**
- Resets your streak to 0
- Honesty helps build better habits
- Tomorrow is a new opportunity!

#### Manual Check-In

- Opens the daily check-in popup
- Useful if you want to mark your study session

### Streak Tips
